# Firewall Playbook Security Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the security fixes and improvements applied to the OPNsense firewall configuration playbooks.

## Date: 2025-07-24

## Fixed Issues

### 1. VPN Key Security (configure-vpn-rules.yml)

**Problem**: Keys were being generated in `/tmp` directory (world-readable)

**Fix Applied**:
- Moved key generation to `/opt/privatebox/credentials/` with 600 permissions
- Created secure directory structure with proper ownership
- Keys are now stored in persistent, secure location
- Fixed key generation to use secure paths with proper permissions

### 2. Configuration Backup Added (All Playbooks)

**Problem**: No backup before making critical changes

**Fix Applied**:
- Added backup task to all firewall playbooks before any changes
- Backups stored in `/opt/privatebox/backups/` with timestamp
- Uses OPNsense backup API endpoint: `/api/core/backup/download/this`
- Backup path included in completion messages

### 3. API Endpoint Corrections

**Problem**: Incorrect API endpoints used

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed alias creation endpoint from `/api/firewall/alias/setItem/{name}` to `/api/firewall/alias/setItem`
- Verified all API endpoints use correct OPNsense paths
- Added proper API error handling with retries

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

**Problem**: No rollback procedures on failure

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added rescue blocks with rollback instructions
- Included retry logic (3 retries, 5 second delay) for transient failures
- Better validation of API responses
- Clear error messages with recovery instructions

### 5. Credential Security

**Problem**: Credentials exposed in debug messages and scripts

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `no_log: true` to credential loading tasks
- Scripts now read credentials from files instead of embedding them
- Removed credential values from any debug output
- Added file existence checks before credential loading

### 6. Directory Creation

**Problem**: Scripts created without ensuring parent directories exist

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added directory creation tasks for all required paths:
  - `/opt/privatebox/scripts/`
  - `/opt/privatebox/credentials/`
  - `/opt/privatebox/backups/`
  - `/opt/privatebox/logs/security/`
  - `/opt/privatebox/reports/`
  - `/opt/privatebox/vpn/`
- Set proper permissions (700/750) on all created directories

## Security Improvements by Playbook

### configure-vpn-rules.yml
- ✅ Secure key storage in `/opt/privatebox/credentials/`
- ✅ Configuration backup before changes
- ✅ Credential file existence checks
- ✅ No-log on sensitive data
- ✅ Retry logic on API calls
- ✅ Secure directory creation
- ✅ Scripts read credentials from files

### configure-firewall-base.yml
- ✅ Configuration backup before changes
- ✅ Credential file existence checks
- ✅ No-log on sensitive data
- ✅ Retry logic on API calls
- ✅ Rescue blocks with rollback instructions
- ✅ Fixed API endpoint for alias creation
- ✅ Secure directory creation

### configure-security-monitoring.yml
- ✅ Configuration backup before changes
- ✅ Credential file existence checks
- ✅ No-log on sensitive data
- ✅ Retry logic on API calls
- ✅ Rescue blocks with error handling
- ✅ Scripts read credentials from files
- ✅ Secure directory creation

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: All directories and files created with minimal required permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (backups, error handling, secure storage)
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Scripts fail safely with clear error messages
4. **Audit Trail**: All actions logged, backups timestamped
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Credentials stored separately from code

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test playbooks in development environment first
2. Verify backup creation before proceeding with changes
3. Test rollback procedures using provided backup files
4. Monitor API responses for any deprecation warnings
5. Validate all created directories have correct permissions

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar security patterns to remaining playbooks:
   - configure-inter-vlan.yml
   - configure-port-forwarding.yml
   - configure-opnsense-boot.yml
   - configure-vlan-bridges.yml

2. Consider implementing:
   - Automated backup rotation
   - Credential rotation mechanism
   - API rate limiting awareness
   - Comprehensive logging of all changes
