## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

1. **Semaphore API Limitations**
   - Risk: API doesn't provide needed functionality
   - Mitigation: Early prototyping, prepare Semaphore PRs
   - Contingency: Build minimal API proxy

2. **Performance at Scale**
   - Risk: Dashboard slow with many services
   - Mitigation: Performance testing throughout
   - Contingency: Implement caching, pagination

3. **State Management Complexity**
   - Risk: Service state tracking unreliable
   - Mitigation: Start with stateless services
   - Contingency: Simplified status for v1

### User Experience Risks

1. **Too Technical**
   - Risk: Non-technical users still confused
   - Mitigation: Regular user testing
   - Contingency: Hire UX consultant

2. **Error Message Quality**
   - Risk: Errors still too technical
   - Mitigation: Build comprehensive translation library
   - Contingency: Community-sourced improvements

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Risk: Poor experience on phones
   - Mitigation: Mobile-first development
   - Contingency: Simplified mobile mode

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the Consumer Dashboard while minimizing risk and maximizing user value. The phased approach allows for continuous validation and adjustment based on real user feedback.

The key to success will be maintaining focus on the non-technical user while ensuring power users aren't constrained. Regular testing with real users throughout development will be critical to achieving this balance.

Remember: This is a living document. As we learn during implementation, we should update this plan to reflect reality and help future contributors understand our journey.
