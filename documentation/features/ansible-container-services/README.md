# Ansible Container Services Feature

## Overview

This feature implements Ansible automation for deploying containerized services using Podman Quadlet on PrivateBox. It provides a simple, maintainable approach optimized for SemaphoreUI integration.

## Summary

### What We're Building

A service-oriented Ansible structure where each container service (AdGuard Home, Pi-hole, etc.) gets its own dedicated playbook. This approach prioritizes:

- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and maintain
- **SemaphoreUI Integration**: Designed for the UI from day one
- **Extensibility**: Simple pattern for adding new services
- **Professional Quality**: Proper error handling, health checks, and testing

### Key Design Decision

We chose a **flat playbook structure** over complex role hierarchies because:
1. It maps perfectly to SemaphoreUI's job template model
2. Each service is self-contained and easy to debug
3. New services can be added by copying a template
4. The slight code duplication is worth the massive gain in clarity

### Architecture

```
ansible/
â”œâ”€â”€ playbooks/services/       # One playbook per service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adguard.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _template.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ files/quadlet/           # Systemd unit templates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ adguard.container.j2
â””â”€â”€ group_vars/              # Shared configuration
```

### Integration with SemaphoreUI

Each service playbook becomes a job template in SemaphoreUI:
- Clear, descriptive names
- Survey variables for customization
- Progress tracking through task names
- Easy to run individually or together

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Deep analysis and thinking
- [x] Document alternatives
- [x] Design implementation
- [x] Plan testing strategy
- [ ] Create Ansible structure
- [ ] Implement AdGuard playbook
- [ ] Create Quadlet template
- [ ] Test deployment
- [ ] Create SemaphoreUI template
- [ ] Document usage

## Next Steps

1. Create the Ansible directory structure as documented
2. Implement the AdGuard Home playbook as the first service
3. Test deployment on development environment
4. Create template for easy service addition
5. Document the process for team members

## For Developers

When implementing this feature:

1. **Follow the pattern** - Don't deviate without updating documentation
2. **Test everything** - Use the testing strategy document
3. **Keep it simple** - Resist the urge to over-engineer
4. **Document changes** - Update this feature documentation
