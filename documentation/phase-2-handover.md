# Phase 2 Handover Document

**Date**: 2025-07-24  
**Current Phase**: Ready for Phase 2 - Network Design & Planning

## Completed Work

### Phase 0: Prerequisites & Information Gathering ✅
All prerequisites have been completed:
- VM hostname resolution fixed in cloud-init configuration
- Podman Quadlet container networking behavior documented (containers bind to VM IP for security)
- AdGuard API comprehensively documented with test scripts
- 100% hands-off AdGuard deployment achieved via Ansible
- System DNS automatically configured to use AdGuard

### Current Infrastructure
- **Proxmox Host**: 192.168.1.10
- **Management VM**: 192.168.1.21 (Ubuntu 24.04)
  - Portainer: Port 9000 (container management)
  - Semaphore: Port 3000 (Ansible UI)
  - AdGuard: Port 8080 web, Port 53 DNS
- **Network**: Flat network on 192.168.1.0/24
- **Services**: All operational and accessible

## Phase 2 Overview

Phase 2 is a **planning and design phase** that prepares for the actual implementation of OPNsense and network segmentation. No implementation work should be done in this phase - only research, planning, and documentation.

### Phase 2 Objectives

1. **Create Detailed Network Design**
   - Finalize VLAN configurations
   - Document all routing requirements
   - Specify exact firewall rules

2. **Plan Zero-Downtime Migration**
   - Design migration strategy from flat to segmented network
   - Ensure continuous access during transition
   - Create rollback procedures

3. **Research OPNsense Automation**
   - Determine automation capabilities
   - Design Ansible deployment approach
   - Document manual requirements

4. **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
   - Identify all potential failure points
   - Create recovery procedures
   - Plan testing approach

## Deliverables Required

### 1. Detailed Firewall Rule Matrix
Create a comprehensive firewall rule document including:
- Source VLAN/IP
- Destination VLAN/IP
- Port(s)
- Protocol
- Action (allow/deny)
- Stateful/stateless
- Justification

Focus areas:
- Inter-VLAN communication rules
- NAT rules for outbound traffic
- Port forwarding requirements
- Management access restrictions
- DNS exception rules

### 2. Migration Runbook
Step-by-step procedures including:
- Pre-migration checklist
- Detailed migration steps with timing
- Testing procedures at each stage
- Go/no-go decision points
- Rollback procedures for each step
- Post-migration validation

Key considerations:
- How to maintain access throughout
- Temporary dual-network approach
- Emergency access procedures
- Communication plan

### 3. OPNsense Automation Design
Research and document:
- VM creation via Ansible (using SSH to Proxmox)
- OPNsense ISO/image preparation
- Initial configuration automation options
- config.xml templating possibilities
- API capabilities post-deployment
- Required manual steps

Technical requirements:
- VM specifications (CPU, RAM, storage)
- Network interface configuration
- Initial IP addressing
- Bootstrap configuration

### 4. Technical Specifications
Document all technical details:
- Proxmox bridge configurations
- VLAN tagging on bridges
- Virtual interface setup
- MTU considerations
- Performance requirements
- Hardware compatibility

### 5. Risk Assessment Document
Comprehensive risk analysis:
- Potential failure scenarios
- Impact assessment
- Mitigation strategies
- Recovery procedures
- Testing requirements

## Key Research Areas

### OPNsense Deployment Automation
1. Can we template the initial config.xml?
2. What's the minimum manual configuration required?
3. How to automate interface assignment?
4. Can we pre-configure admin credentials?
5. What bootstrap options are available?

### Network Migration Strategy
1. Should we implement all VLANs at once or incrementally?
2. How to test VLAN configuration without affecting production?
3. Best approach for temporary dual-network operation?
4. When to migrate each service to new network?

### Technical Considerations
1. Proxmox VLAN-aware bridge configuration syntax
2. Performance impact of inter-VLAN routing
3. High availability options for OPNsense
4. Backup network paths if OPNsense fails

### DNS Architecture (Already Defined)
```
Client Device → AdGuard (10.0.20.21:53) → Unbound (10.0.20.1:5353) → Internet
```

### Service Communication Matrix (Already Defined)
| From / To | Management | Services | LAN | IoT | Internet |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----|-----|----------|
| Management| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Services | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| LAN | ✗ | DNS only | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| IoT | ✗ | DNS only | ✗ | ✓ | Limited |

- Ansible Service Pattern: `/ansible/playbooks/services/_template.yml`

## Phase 2 Success Criteria

- [ ] All firewall rules documented with justification
- [ ] Migration plan ensures zero downtime
- [ ] OPNsense automation approach fully researched
- [ ] All technical specifications documented
- [ ] Risk assessment complete with mitigation plans
- [ ] Clear implementation path for Phase 3

## Recommended Timeline

- **Week 1**: Research and initial design
- **Week 2**: Detailed documentation creation
- **Week 3**: Review, refinement, and finalization

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Known Issue**: Semaphore SSH authentication for Ansible playbooks needs resolution before full automation
2. **Design Principle**: Maintain same hands-off deployment approach achieved with AdGuard
3. **Testing**: Consider creating isolated test environment for VLAN experiments
4. **Documentation**: Visual network diagrams would be valuable additions

Phase 2 completion will provide a solid foundation for Phase 3 (OPNsense Deployment) implementation.
