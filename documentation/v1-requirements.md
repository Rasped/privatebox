# PrivateBox Release Requirements & Status

## Release Strategy

PrivateBox has a two-phase release approach:

### Phase 1: FOSS Release (Current Focus)
Open source release for self-deployment on Proxmox. Goal: Working system that technical users can deploy in their own infrastructure.

**Target**: Public GitHub release, community adoption, testing in production environments

### Phase 2: Product Release (Future)
Commercial appliance for consumers. Adds commercial features, recovery infrastructure, and warranty support on top of FOSS base.

**Target**: Pre-configured Intel N150 hardware, sold to consumers by SubRosa ApS (Denmark), late 2025 launch

### üîß NEEDS VERIFICATION

#### Headscale/Headplane Live Testing
**Status**: Deployed and tested internally, not tested from external network

**Required Testing**:
- Connect Tailscale client from outside network to Headscale
- Verify subnet routes propagate correctly
- Access internal services (portainer.lan, etc.) through VPN
- Test DNS resolution through AdGuard while on VPN

### üìã OPTIONAL (Nice-to-Have)

#### Manual Update Playbooks
**Status**: Services deployed but no formal update procedures

**Scope**: Semaphore playbooks for user-initiated updates:
- Proxmox host updates (apt)
- OPNsense firmware updates
- Management VM updates (apt)
- Container image updates (Portainer/Semaphore/AdGuard/Homer/Caddy)

**Note**: Can be deferred to post-FOSS release or Product release. Homer auto-updates; others update manually via web UIs.

### ‚ùå OUT OF SCOPE (Product Release Only)

These features are deferred to Product release:
- Encrypted backup system (LUKS partition)
- Recovery infrastructure (7 partitions, factory reset)
- Offline asset storage
- Golden image creation
- CE marking, WEEE registration, warranty support

---

## FOSS Release Success Criteria

## FOSS Release Checklist

Before tagging FOSS v1.0:

1. **Live VPN Testing**
   - [ ] Deploy Headscale client on external device
   - [ ] Connect to Headscale from outside network
   - [ ] Verify subnet routing works
   - [ ] Access internal services through VPN
   - [ ] Test DNS resolution through AdGuard via VPN

2. **Clean Deployment Test**
   - [ ] Delete all VMs
   - [ ] Run quickstart.sh on fresh Proxmox
   - [ ] Verify all services deploy without errors
   - [ ] Check logs for issues
   - [ ] Test all service access

3. **Production Testing**
   - [ ] Deploy in user's home network
   - [ ] Run for 1+ week without intervention

## Current Status Summary

### Ready for FOSS Release (Pending Testing)
‚úÖ Core system fully functional
‚úÖ All services deployed and working
‚úÖ TLS certificates automatic
‚úÖ DNS filtering active
‚ö†Ô∏è VPN needs live testing
‚è≥ Production stability testing needed

### Timeline
- **Now**: Live testing phase (user's home network)
- **1-2 weeks**: Production stability verification
- **Then**: FOSS v1.0 release (public GitHub)
- **Future**: Product release (commercial appliance)

## VPN Strategy Change

**Original Plan**: OpenVPN + WireGuard on OPNsense
**Current Plan**: Headscale only (self-hosted Tailscale control server)

**Rationale**:
- Headscale provides modern VPN with minimal configuration
- Tailscale clients available for all platforms
- Easier for users than managing OpenVPN configs
- Subnet routing built-in for accessing all services
- No port forwarding required (NAT traversal automatic)

**Implementation**:
- Headscale server running at https://10.10.20.10:4443
- Headplane UI for management at https://headplane.lan
- VM 101 acts as subnet router (10.10.20.x and 10.10.10.x)
- VPN clients use AdGuard for DNS filtering

---

## Notes

### Update Philosophy
- **Manual updates only** (user-initiated via Semaphore or web UIs)
- **Homer exception**: Auto-updates (display-only, low risk)
- **Rationale**: Respects user agency, prevents unexpected breakage, reduces liability

### Hardware Assumptions (FOSS)
- Proxmox already installed and configured
- Network access to Proxmox host
- Sufficient resources (8GB+ RAM recommended)
- Internet connectivity for pulling images/packages

### Hardware Requirements (Product)
- Intel N150 mini PC
- 16GB RAM (not 8GB)
- 256GB SSD
- Dual NICs
- VGA/HDMI for physical console
