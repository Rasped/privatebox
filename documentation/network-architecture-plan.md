# PrivateBox Network Architecture Plan

**Created**: 2025-07-24  
**Status**: Implementation Planning  
**Version**: 1.0

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the network architecture implementation plan for PrivateBox, focusing on creating a secure, segmented network with proper DNS filtering and recursive resolution. The plan addresses current issues, defines the target architecture, and provides a phased implementation approach with clear dependencies and risk mitigation strategies.

### Key Goals
1. Deploy OPNsense as the primary router/firewall
2. Establish AdGuard Home for DNS filtering  
3. Configure Unbound for recursive DNS resolution
4. Implement VLAN-based network segmentation
5. Create a secure, maintainable DNS chain

### Critical Success Factors
- Zero network downtime during migration
- Maintain management access throughout
- DNS resolution working end-to-end
- Proper network isolation between VLANs
- All services accessible post-migration

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working
- **Proxmox Host**: Operational on 192.168.1.10
- **Management VM**: Successfully deployed at 192.168.1.21
- **Container Services**: 
  - Portainer running on port 9000
  - Semaphore running on port 3000
- **Basic Infrastructure**: Bootstrap phase completed successfully

### What Needs Fixing
1. **AdGuard Container Issues**:
   - Binding to external IP (192.168.1.21) instead of all interfaces
   - Health check failing due to checking 127.0.0.1:8080
   - DNS port 53 non-functional until manual setup complete
   - Playbook fails due to incorrect health check

2. **Network Architecture**:
   - No network segmentation (everything on flat network)
   - No firewall/router VM deployed
   - No VLAN configuration
   - DNS services not properly integrated

3. **Security Concerns**:
   - All services exposed on management network
   - No traffic filtering between services
   - No DNS security (DNSSEC, DoT)

## Target Architecture

    ↓ DNS Query (port 53)
AdGuard Home (10.0.20.21:53)
    ↓ Filtered Query (port 5353)

    ↓ Recursive Query (DoT/DNSSEC)
Public DNS Servers (1.1.1.1, 9.9.9.9)
```

### Service Communication Matrix

| From / To | Management | Services | LAN | IoT | Internet |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----|-----|----------|
| Management| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Services | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| LAN | ✗ | DNS only | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| IoT | ✗ | DNS only | ✗ | ✓ | Limited |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Fix Current Issues (Days 1-3)

#### 1.1 Fix AdGuard Container Binding
- **Problem**: Container binds to specific IP, health check expects localhost
- **Solution**: 
  - Option A: Modify Quadlet template to bind to 0.0.0.0
  - Option B: Update health check to use actual IP
  - Option C: Use host networking mode
- **Decision**: Option B (least invasive, maintains security)
- **Tasks**:
  - ✓ Update health check in playbook to use `ansible_default_ipv4.address`
  - Create post-install configuration playbook
  - Add automatic setup completion via API

#### 1.2 Stabilize DNS Service
- Configure AdGuard for automatic startup
- Implement proper health monitoring
- Document manual setup requirements
- Create recovery procedures

### Phase 2: Network Design & Planning (Days 4-7)

#### 2.1 Detailed Network Design
- **IP Addressing Scheme**:
  ```
  Management: 10.0.10.0/24
    Gateway: 10.0.10.1 (OPNsense)
    Proxmox: 10.0.10.10
    
  Services: 10.0.20.0/24  
    Gateway: 10.0.20.1 (OPNsense)
    Management VM: 10.0.20.21
    AdGuard: 10.0.20.21 (container)
    Reserved: 10.0.20.30-50 (future services)
    
  LAN: 10.0.30.0/24
    Gateway: 10.0.30.1 (OPNsense)
    DHCP Pool: 10.0.30.100-200
    
  IoT: 10.0.40.0/24
    Gateway: 10.0.40.1 (OPNsense)
    DHCP Pool: 10.0.40.100-200
  ```

#### 2.2 Firewall Rules Planning
- Default deny all inter-VLAN traffic
- Allow specific services (documented per VLAN)
- DNS exceptions for all VLANs to Services VLAN
- Management access only from Management VLAN

### Phase 3: OPNsense Deployment (Days 8-10)

#### 3.1 Create OPNsense VM
- **Specifications**:
  - vCPU: 2 cores minimum
  - RAM: 2GB minimum (4GB recommended)
  - Storage: 20GB
  - Network: 2+ interfaces (WAN + LAN)

#### 3.2 OPNsense Playbook Development
```yaml
# Key tasks:
- Create VM via SSH to Proxmox
- Attach to WAN bridge (vmbr0)
- Create VLAN-aware LAN bridge (vmbr1)
- Configure initial network settings
- Enable required services
```

#### 3.3 Initial Configuration
- WAN: DHCP client
- LAN: VLAN trunk with sub-interfaces
- Basic firewall rules
- Enable Unbound DNS on port 5353

### Phase 4: DNS Chain Configuration (Days 11-12)

#### 4.1 Unbound Configuration on OPNsense
- Move to port 5353 (avoid conflict with AdGuard)
- Enable DNSSEC validation
- Configure DNS over TLS upstream
- Set up local zone for internal resolution
- Configure access control (only from Services VLAN)

#### 4.2 AdGuard Upstream Configuration  
- Set Unbound as upstream: `10.0.20.1:5353`
- Configure local domain resolution: `[/privatebox.local/]10.0.20.1:5353`
- Enable DNSSEC checking (rely on Unbound)
- Configure query logging

#### 4.3 Testing & Validation
- Test DNS resolution from each VLAN
- Verify DNSSEC validation
- Check ad blocking functionality
- Monitor query performance

### Phase 5: Network Migration (Days 13-14)

#### 5.1 Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Document current network settings
- [ ] Backup all configurations
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Test in isolated environment

#### 5.2 Migration Steps
1. Configure VLANs on physical switches (if applicable)
2. Update Proxmox network configuration
3. Migrate Management VM to Services VLAN
4. Update DNS settings on all devices
5. Test connectivity from each VLAN
6. Apply final firewall rules

#### 5.3 Post-Migration Validation
- All services accessible
- DNS resolution working
- Inter-VLAN routing as designed
- No security policy violations
- Performance acceptable

## Critical Decision Points

### 1. AdGuard Binding Strategy
**Options Evaluated**:
- **Option A**: Bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
  - Pros: Maximum flexibility, works with any IP
  - Cons: Less secure, exposes on all interfaces
- **Option B**: Fix health checks to use correct IP ✓
  - Pros: Maintains security, minimal changes
  - Cons: Requires playbook updates
- **Option C**: Use host networking mode
  - Pros: Simplifies networking
  - Cons: Less isolation, port conflicts

**Decision**: Option B - Fix health checks while maintaining security

### 2. DNS Architecture Model
**Options Evaluated**:
- **Option A**: Client → AdGuard → Unbound → Internet ✓
  - Pros: Filtering first, clean recursive resolution
  - Cons: Single point of failure
- **Option B**: Client → Unbound → AdGuard → Internet
  - Pros: Recursive first, optional filtering
  - Cons: Complex configuration, filtering limitations
- **Option C**: Parallel DNS servers
  - Pros: Redundancy
  - Cons: Complex management, inconsistent results

**Decision**: Option A - AdGuard first for optimal filtering

### 3. Network Complexity
**Options Evaluated**:
- **Option A**: Simple (Management, LAN, DMZ)
  - Pros: Easy to manage
  - Cons: Limited isolation
- **Option B**: Moderate (+ IoT, Guest) ✓
  - Pros: Good balance, practical isolation
  - Cons: More complex than basic
- **Option C**: Complex (per-service VLANs)
  - Pros: Maximum isolation
  - Cons: Management overhead

**Decision**: Option B - Balanced approach for home/small business

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Loss of Network Connectivity
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:
- Maintain out-of-band management access
- Test all changes in dev environment first
- Document rollback procedures
- Keep ISP router accessible as fallback

### Risk 2: DNS Service Failure
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:
- Configure fallback DNS servers
- Monitor DNS service health
- Implement automatic service restart
- Document manual recovery steps

### Risk 3: Misconfigured Firewall Rules
**Probability**: High  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**:
- Start with permissive rules, tighten gradually
- Test each rule change thoroughly
- Log all traffic during testing
- Have console access for recovery

### Risk 4: VLAN Configuration Errors
**Probability**: Medium  
**Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**:
- Validate configuration in test environment
- Implement changes incrementally
- Keep detailed network documentation
- Test from each VLAN after changes
