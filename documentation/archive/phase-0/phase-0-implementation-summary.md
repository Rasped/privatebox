# Phase 0 Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Status**: Completed  

## Overview

Phase 0 addressed critical prerequisites and issues discovered during initial AdGuard deployment. All issues have been resolved to ensure 100% hands-off installation.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. VM Hostname Resolution ✅
**Problem**: `sudo: unable to resolve host ubuntu` errors  
**Solution**: Added hostname configuration to cloud-init:
```yaml
hostname: ubuntu
manage_etc_hosts: true
```
**File**: `bootstrap/scripts/create-ubuntu-vm.sh`

### 2. AdGuard Container Health Check ✅
**Problem**: Health check failed because container binds to VM IP (192.168.1.21) but health check expected localhost  
**Solution**: Updated health check to use VM's actual IP address:
```
HealthCmd=/bin/sh -c "wget -q --spider http://{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}:3000 || exit 1"
```
**File**: `ansible/files/quadlet/adguard.container.j2`

### 3. AdGuard Initial Setup Redirect ✅
**Problem**: Playbook failed when AdGuard redirected to `/control/install.html` for initial setup  
**Solution**: Added `follow_redirects: none` and handle 302 status codes properly  
**File**: `ansible/playbooks/services/adguard.yml`

### 4. Automatic AdGuard Configuration ✅
**Problem**: Manual setup was required through web UI  
**Solution**: Integrated automatic configuration using AdGuard API:
- Check configuration with `/control/install/check_config`
- Apply configuration with `/control/install/configure`
- Auto-generate secure admin password
- Configure upstream DNS servers (Cloudflare, Quad9)
- Update system DNS to use AdGuard
**File**: `ansible/playbooks/services/adguard.yml`

### 5. Semaphore DNS Resolution ✅
**Problem**: Semaphore container couldn't resolve DNS after systemd-resolved was disabled  
**Solution**: Added Semaphore restart after DNS configuration to pick up new settings  
**File**: `ansible/playbooks/services/adguard.yml`

### 6. Container Binding Strategy ✅
**Investigation Result**: Binding to specific IP (192.168.1.21) is actually more secure than 0.0.0.0  
**Decision**: Keep current approach, just fix health checks to match

## Key Implementation Details

### Password Management
- Auto-generates secure 20-character password if not exists
- Stores in `/etc/privatebox-adguard-password` with 0600 permissions
- Reuses existing password on subsequent runs (idempotent)

### DNS Configuration Flow
1. Disable systemd-resolved to free port 53
2. Set temporary DNS (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, 9.9.9.9)
3. Deploy AdGuard container
4. Automatically configure AdGuard via API
5. Test DNS resolution through AdGuard
6. Update system DNS to use AdGuard (with fallbacks)
7. Restart Semaphore to pick up new DNS

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /control/status` - Check if configured
- `POST /control/install/check_config` - Validate configuration
- `POST /control/install/configure` - Apply initial setup
- `POST /control/protection` - Enable protection
- `POST /control/dns_config` - Configure upstream DNS

## Testing Tools Created

### test-adguard-api.sh
Manual testing script for debugging API endpoints:
```bash
./test-adguard-api.sh <host> <port> <username> <password>
```
Located in: `ansible/files/scripts/test-adguard-api.sh`

## Results

All Phase 0 objectives achieved:
- ✅ No more hostname resolution errors
- ✅ Health checks work correctly
- ✅ AdGuard configures automatically
- ✅ DNS works end-to-end without manual intervention
- ✅ Semaphore can resolve DNS properly
- ✅ 100% hands-off deployment achieved

## Next Steps

With Phase 0 complete, the system is ready for:
1. Phase 1: Fix remaining issues and stabilize services
2. Phase 2: Network design and VLAN planning
3. Phase 3: OPNsense deployment for proper routing/firewall

The AdGuard deployment is now fully automated and production-ready.
