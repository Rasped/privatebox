**Assigned to**: automation-engineer  
**Created by**: privatebox-orchestrator  
**Date**: 2025-01-25  
**Priority**: Medium  

## Objective

Analyze the dev notes file `/dev-notes/bootstrap-hands-off-issues.md` to determine if the documented issues are still relevant or have been resolved. If resolved, the file should be deleted. If still relevant, it should be moved to appropriate documentation.

## Background

During repository cleanup, we identified several dev-notes files that may contain outdated information. Each file needs individual investigation to determine its current relevance.

## Specific Tasks

1. **Read and Analyze the File**
   - Location: `/dev-notes/bootstrap-hands-off-issues.md`
   - Understand what issues were documented
   - Check if these relate to current bootstrap functionality

2. **Verify Current State**
   - Test if the documented issues still exist in the current bootstrap process
   - Check recent commits to see if fixes were implemented
   - Look for related code in `/bootstrap/scripts/`

3. **Make Decision**
   - If issues are RESOLVED: Delete the file
   - If issues STILL EXIST: Move to `/documentation/known-issues/` or similar
   - If PARTIALLY RESOLVED: Update the file with current status

## Success Criteria

- Clear determination of whether issues are still relevant
- Appropriate action taken (delete or move)
- Brief summary of findings

## Tools and Resources

- Current bootstrap scripts in `/bootstrap/`
- Recent test logs showing bootstrap execution
- Git history for bootstrap-related changes

## Output Expected

Brief report stating:
1. What issues were documented
2. Current status of each issue
3. Action taken (deleted/moved/updated)
4. Any recommendations for bootstrap improvements if issues remain
