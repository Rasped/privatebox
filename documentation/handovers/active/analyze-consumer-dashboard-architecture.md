# Handover: Analyze consumer-dashboard-architecture.md

**Assigned to**: automation-engineer  
**Created by**: privatebox-orchestrator  
**Date**: 2025-01-25  
**Priority**: Medium  

## Objective

Analyze the dev notes file `/dev-notes/consumer-dashboard-architecture.md` to determine if this feature/architecture is still planned, relevant, or should be removed from the repository.

## Background

During repository cleanup, we identified several dev-notes files that may contain outdated information. This file appears to describe a consumer dashboard architecture that may or may not be part of the current PrivateBox roadmap.

## Specific Tasks

1. **Read and Understand the Architecture**
   - Location: `/dev-notes/consumer-dashboard-architecture.md`
   - Understand what was being planned
   - Identify if this aligns with current PrivateBox goals

2. **Check for Related Implementation**
   - Search codebase for any dashboard-related code
   - Check if this feature appears in any documentation
   - Look for related issues or commits

3. **Determine Relevance**
   - Is this feature mentioned in current project docs?
   - Does it align with PrivateBox's privacy-focused router vision?
   - Are there any partial implementations?

4. **Make Decision**
   - If IRRELEVANT: Delete the file
   - If FUTURE FEATURE: Move to `/documentation/features/consumer-dashboard/`
   - If ABANDONED: Archive with explanation

## Success Criteria

- Clear understanding of what the dashboard was meant to do
- Decision on whether it fits PrivateBox's current direction
- Appropriate action taken with the file

## Tools and Resources

- Current README and ARCHITECTURE.md for project vision
- Feature documentation in `/documentation/features/`
- Codebase search for dashboard references

## Output Expected

Brief report stating:
1. What the consumer dashboard architecture proposed
2. Whether it aligns with current PrivateBox goals
3. Action taken (deleted/moved/archived)
4. If kept, recommendations for next steps
