# Phase 6 Repository Fix Summary

## Issue
Repository creation was failing with 404 in Semaphore v2.15.0 during Phase 6 testing.

## Root Cause Investigation
Through API testing with curl, discovered that:
1. The endpoint `/api/project/{id}/repositories` DOES exist
2. It requires additional fields in the request body:
   - `project_id` must be included in the body (matching the URL)
   - `git_branch` is required (not optional)

## Current Implementation Status
The script (`bootstrap/scripts/semaphore-setup.sh`) already has the correct implementation:
```json
{
    "name": "$name",
    "project_id": $pid,
    "git_url": "$url", 
    "git_branch": "main",
    "ssh_key_id": null
}
```

## Test Results
Successfully created a repository using curl:
```bash
curl -b /tmp/semaphore-cookie -X POST http://192.168.1.21:3000/api/project/1/repositories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": 1,
    "name": "Template Sync Repo",
    "git_url": "https://github.com/semaphoreui/semaphore-templates.git",
    "git_branch": "main",
    "ssh_key_id": 1
  }'
```

Response: HTTP 201 Created with repository ID 1.

## Conclusion
No code changes needed. The implementation is correct and should work in the next test run. The previous failures were likely due to:
1. The two already-fixed issues (API token capture and environment JSON format)
2. Possible timing or state issues during the test

## Next Steps
Run a full end-to-end test of Phase 6 implementation to verify:
1. Repository creation succeeds
2. Template creation succeeds with the repository ID
3. Initial template sync runs successfully
