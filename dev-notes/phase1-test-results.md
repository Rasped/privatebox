# Phase 1 Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-07-10

### Test Environment
- Proxmox Host: 192.168.1.10
- VM ID: 9000
- VM IP: 192.168.1.21

### Initial Test: FAILED

#### Issue Discovered
Semaphore UI failed to start with the following error:
```
panic: invalid character 'p' looking for beginning of object key string
```

#### Root Cause
The SEMAPHORE_APPS environment variable in the quadlet file:
```
Environment=SEMAPHORE_APPS={"python":{"active":true,"priority":500}}
```

Was being transformed by systemd when passing to podman as:
```
--env SEMAPHORE_APPS={python:{active:true,priority:500}}
```

The quotes around JSON keys were stripped, making it invalid JSON.

### Fix Applied
Changed the line in `bootstrap/scripts/semaphore-setup.sh` to use single quotes:
```bash
Environment=SEMAPHORE_APPS='{"python":{"active":true,"priority":500}}'
```

### Fix Status
- ✅ Root cause identified
- ✅ Fix implemented and committed
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub (commit 9e8ed0b)
- ⏳ Awaiting re-test with fixed bootstrap

## Lessons Learned

1. **Systemd Quadlet JSON Handling**: JSON values in Environment= directives need proper quoting to survive systemd's parsing
2. **Testing Required**: Environment variable features need to be tested in actual deployment, not just assumed to work
3. **Error Messages**: Semaphore provides clear panic messages that helped identify the exact issue

## Next Steps

1. Re-deploy bootstrap from GitHub with the fix
2. Verify Semaphore starts successfully
3. Check if Python is automatically enabled in Applications menu
4. Test Python script execution
5. Document final Phase 1 status
