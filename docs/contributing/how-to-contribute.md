# How to Contribute to PrivateBox

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project is built on open-source principles, and it thrives on the involvement of the community.

There are many ways to contribute, and not all of them involve writing code.

## Reporting bugs

If you've found a bug in the automation scripts or a problem that you believe is not just a configuration issue, the best way to let us know is by opening an issue on our GitHub repository.

**A good bug report includes:**
*   A clear title and description of the issue.
*   The steps you took to encounter the bug.
*   What you expected to happen, and what actually happened.
*   If possible, the **Report ID** from the [Health Check System](./advanced/health-check.md) is incredibly helpful.

## Improving documentation

Our documentation is an open-source project in itself. If you find a typo, think a guide is unclear, or want to write a new guide, your contributions are very welcome. The documentation files are located in the `/docs` directory of the GitHub repository. You can submit changes via a Pull Request.

## Contributing code

If you are a developer and want to contribute to the code, we follow a standard open-source workflow.

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  Create a new **branch** for your feature or bugfix.
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Submit a **Pull Request** back to the main repository.
