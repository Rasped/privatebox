# How-To: Set Up Your Portainer Account

Portainer is a powerful tool for managing some of the applications running on your PrivateBox. For security reasons, it does not come with a pre-configured account. You must create your own administrator account.

**IMPORTANT: This action must be performed within 5 minutes of starting your PrivateBox for the first time, or after any reboot.**

### 1. Access Portainer

Within 5 minutes of a system boot, open a web browser and go to:

`https://portainer.lan`

*Note: You must be connected to your **Trusted** network to access this address.*

### 2. Create Your Admin User

You will be presented with the Portainer administrator user creation screen.

- **Username:** Choose a username. We recommend `admin`.
- **Password:** Create a strong password. 

**Recommendation:** Your PrivateBox came with a pre-generated `services password` printed on the sticker on the bottom of the unit. For convenience, you may choose to reuse this password here, but you are free to create any password you wish.

- **Confirm Password:** Enter the password again.

Click the **"Create user"** button.

### 3. Complete Setup

After creating your user, Portainer will ask you to select your environment. Choose **"Local"** and click **"Connect"**.

---

That's it. Your Portainer account is now set up. You will not need to do this again unless you perform a factory reset of your device.
