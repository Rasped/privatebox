# Finding your router settings

This guide helps you locate and access your router's admin interface.

## Finding your router's admin page

If an address doesn't work, your browser will show an error like 'This site can’t be reached'. This is normal. Simply try the next address in the list until one loads a login page.

Common router admin URLs (try these in order):
- http://192.168.1.1
- http://192.168.0.1
- http://10.0.0.1
- http://192.168.1.254

The one that loads is your router's admin page.

## Finding login credentials

Check these locations in order:

1. **Sticker on router:** Look on the bottom or back for "admin password" or "default password"
2. **Router manual:** Check the quick start guide that came with your router
3. **Search online:** "[your router model] default password"

Common default combinations:
- Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`
- Username: `admin`, Password: `password`
- Username: `admin`, Password: [blank - just press enter]

## Identifying your router model

Look for a label on:
- Bottom of router
- Back panel
- Side panel

It will show something like "Model: RT-AC68U" or similar. You need this for searching specific instructions.

## Search terms for common tasks

### To disable DHCP server
- "disable DHCP [router model]"
- "turn off DHCP server [router model]"
- "[router model] DHCP settings"

### To enable access point mode
- "AP mode [router model]"
- "access point mode [router model]"
- "[router model] operation mode"

### Example searches
- "disable DHCP Asus RT-AC68U"
- "TP-Link Archer C7 AP mode"
- "Netgear R7000 turn off DHCP"
