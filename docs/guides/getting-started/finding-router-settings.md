# Finding your router settings

This guide helps you locate and access your router's admin interface.

## Finding your router's admin page

Common router admin URLs (try these in order):
- http://192.168.1.1
- http://192.168.0.1
- http://10.0.0.1
- http://192.168.1.254

The one that loads is your router's admin page.

## Finding login credentials

Check these locations in order:

1. **Sticker on router:** Look on the bottom or back for "admin password" or "default password"
2. **Router manual:** Check the quick start guide that came with your router
3. **Search online:** "[your router model] default password"

Common default combinations:
- Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`
- Username: `admin`, Password: `password`
- Username: `admin`, Password: [blank - just press enter]

## Identifying your router model

Look for a label on:
- Bottom of router
- Back panel
- Side panel

It will show something like "Model: RT-AC68U" or similar. You need this for searching specific instructions.

## Search terms for common tasks

### To disable DHCP server
- "disable DHCP [router model]"
- "turn off DHCP server [router model]"
- "[router model] DHCP settings"

### To enable access point mode
- "AP mode [router model]"
- "access point mode [router model]"
- "[router model] operation mode"

### Example searches
- "disable DHCP Asus RT-AC68U"
- "TP-Link Archer C7 AP mode"
- "Netgear R7000 turn off DHCP"
