# Streamlined Bootstrap Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Single Entry Point Script: `bootstrap.sh`
- Makes all scripts executable automatically
- Runs network discovery
- Creates VM with WAIT_FOR_CLOUD_INIT=true
- Handles both success and timeout scenarios gracefully

### 2. Fixed Cloud-init Integration
- Fixed script embedding paths to use absolute paths
- Enabled execution of post-install-setup.sh
- Added completion marker file creation
- Scripts now properly embed into cloud-init

### 3. Cloud-init Completion Detection
- Added `wait_for_cloud_init()` function
- Waits up to 15 minutes for SSH availability
- Checks for completion marker file
- Verifies services are running

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Clear progress messages during wait
- Handles timeouts gracefully
- Provides manual verification instructions
- Shows all access information at the end

## Current Status

The streamlined bootstrap is working but has one known issue:
- SSH takes longer than expected to become available
- This appears to be due to cloud-init's initial boot process
- The VM is created successfully and cloud-init runs

## Usage

```bash
# Copy to Proxmox host
rsync -avz bootstrap/ root@proxmox:/tmp/bootstrap/

# Run single command
ssh root@proxmox "cd /tmp/bootstrap && ./bootstrap.sh"
```

## What Happens

1. Scripts are made executable
2. Network is auto-discovered
3. VM is created with discovered settings
4. Script waits for cloud-init (may timeout)
5. Access information is displayed

## Next Steps

To improve the SSH availability issue:
1. Consider adding a pre-SSH wait period
2. Investigate cloud-init's SSH configuration timing
3. Add alternative verification methods

## Key Files Modified

- `bootstrap.sh` - New single entry point
- `create-ubuntu-vm.sh` - Fixed paths, added wait function
- Cloud-init now properly executes setup scripts
