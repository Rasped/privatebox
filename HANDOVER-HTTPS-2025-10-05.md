# HANDOVER: Complete HTTPS Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (100%)
**Priority:** High (blocks customer perception of security)

## Context

Implementing self-signed HTTPS for all management services to meet market expectations. Competitors (UniFi, Firewalla) ship with HTTPS by default. HTTP for €399 "privacy appliance" is unacceptable.

## Port Scheme (Sequential x443 Pattern)

```
1443  Portainer   (HTTPS) ✅ Complete
2443  Semaphore   (HTTPS) ✅ Complete
3443  AdGuard     (HTTPS) ⚠️  Partial (needs validate_certs)
4443  Headscale   (HTTPS) ❌ Pending
8081  Homer       (HTTP)  ❌ Needs link updates
```

## What's Been Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Bootstrap Services (Committed)

**Files Modified:**
- `bootstrap/setup-guest.sh`
- `bootstrap/lib/semaphore-api.sh`

**Changes:**
1. **Certificate Generation**
   - Location: `/etc/privatebox/certs/privatebox.{crt,key}`
   - Type: Self-signed RSA 4096-bit
   - Validity: 10 years
   - SAN: `IP:10.10.20.10`, `DNS:privatebox.local`, `DNS:*.privatebox.local`
   - Generated during bootstrap before service deployment

2. **Portainer (port 1443)**
   - Quadlet updated: mount `/etc/privatebox/certs:/certs:ro`
   - Added: `Exec=--ssl --sslcert /certs/privatebox.crt --sslkey /certs/privatebox.key`
   - Port: `PublishPort=1443:9443`
   - Health checks: `curl -sfk https://localhost:1443/api/status`

3. **Semaphore (port 2443)**
   - config.json updated: `"port": "3443"`, `"web": {"listen": "0.0.0.0:3443"}`
   - Added: `"ssl_cert": "/certs/privatebox.crt"`, `"ssl_key": "/certs/privatebox.key"`
   - Quadlet: mount `/etc/privatebox/certs:/certs:ro`
   - Port: `PublishPort=2443:3443`
   - Health checks: `curl -sfk https://localhost:2443/api/ping`

4. **Semaphore API (semaphore-api.sh)**
   - All URLs: `http://localhost:3000` → `https://localhost:2443`
   - All curl commands: added `-k` flag for self-signed cert
   - Functions updated: `wait_for_semaphore_api()`, `get_admin_session()`, `make_api_request()`

### ✅ Phase 2: AdGuard (Partially Committed)

**Files Modified:**
- `ansible/playbooks/services/adguard-deploy.yml`
- `ansible/files/quadlet/adguard.container.j2`

**Changes:**
1. Port changed: `8080` → `3443`
2. Quadlet: added `Volume=/etc/privatebox/certs:/certs:ro`
3. Created AdGuardHome.yaml with TLS config:
   ```yaml
   tls:
     enabled: true
     server_name: privatebox.local
     port_https: 3000
     certificate_chain: /certs/privatebox.crt
     private_key: /certs/privatebox.key
   ```
4. All HTTP URLs replaced with HTTPS (12 uri tasks)

**⚠️ CRITICAL MISSING:** `validate_certs: no` not added to uri tasks (will fail on self-signed cert)

## What Remains (Ordered by Priority)

### Task 1: Fix AdGuard uri Tasks (CRITICAL)

**Why Critical:** AdGuard deployment will fail without this. All 12 uri tasks will reject self-signed cert.

**File:** `ansible/playbooks/services/adguard-deploy.yml`

**Action:** Add `validate_certs: no` to every `uri:` task

**Lines to update:**
- Line 214: Wait for AdGuard Home to be ready
- Line 379: Wait for AdGuard API to be available
- Line 391: Check if AdGuard is already configured
- Line 410: Check initial configuration
- Line 427: Apply AdGuard configuration
- Line 449: Verify AdGuard is now configured
- Line 469: Enable protection
- Line 482: Configure upstream DNS servers
- Line 507: Configure DNS blocklists
- Line 528: Enable and update blocklists
- Line 570: Get AdGuard statistics

**Example:**
```yaml
- name: Wait for AdGuard Home to be ready
  uri:
    url: "https://{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}:{{ custom_web_port }}/"
    validate_certs: no  # <-- ADD THIS LINE
    status_code: [200, 302]
```

**Estimated time:** 15 minutes

---

### Task 2: Headscale HTTPS (port 4443)

**File:** `ansible/playbooks/services/headscale-deploy.yml`

**Current state:** Uses HTTP on port 8082

**Changes needed:**

1. **Find the Headscale config template** (likely in `ansible/files/` or inline)
2. **Update port:** `8082` → `4443`
3. **Add TLS config:**
   ```yaml
   server_url: https://10.10.20.10:4443
   listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:4443
   tls_cert_path: /certs/privatebox.crt
   tls_key_path: /certs/privatebox.key
   ```
4. **Update Quadlet/systemd unit:**
   - Add volume mount: `/etc/privatebox/certs:/certs:ro`
   - Update published port: `4443:4443`
5. **Update health checks** (if any) to HTTPS with `-k` flag
6. **Update all uri tasks** (if any) with `validate_certs: no`

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

---

### Task 3: Homer Dashboard Links

**File:** `ansible/templates/homer/config.yml`

**Current state:** Shows HTTP URLs

**Changes needed:**

Update all service links to HTTPS with new ports:

```yaml
services:
  - name: "Management"
    icon: "fas fa-cog"
    items:
      - name: "Portainer"
        subtitle: "Container Management"
        url: "https://10.10.20.10:1443"  # was 9000

      - name: "Semaphore"
        subtitle: "Automation Engine"
        url: "https://10.10.20.10:2443"  # was 3000

      - name: "AdGuard Home"
        subtitle: "DNS & Ad Blocking"
        url: "https://10.10.20.10:3443"  # was 8080

      - name: "Headscale"
        subtitle: "VPN Control Plane"
        url: "https://10.10.20.10:4444"  # was 8082

      - name: "OPNsense"
        subtitle: "Firewall"
        url: "https://10.10.20.1"  # already HTTPS
```

**Note:** Add banner about certificate warnings on first access

**Estimated time:** 15 minutes

---

### Task 4: Bootstrap Output URLs

**Files:**
- `bootstrap/bootstrap.sh` (final summary)
- `bootstrap/verify-install.sh` (health checks)

**bootstrap.sh changes:**

Find the final output section (around line 330-340) and update:

```bash
display "Service Access:"
display "  Portainer: https://10.10.20.10:1443"  # was 9000
display "  Semaphore: https://10.10.20.10:2443"  # was 3000
display "  Admin Password: $SERVICES_PASSWORD"
display ""
display "⚠️  First visit: Click 'Advanced' → 'Proceed' to trust certificate"
display "   (This is normal for network appliances)"
```

**verify-install.sh changes:**

Find health check URLs and update:

```bash
# Check Portainer
if curl -sfk https://10.10.20.10:1443/api/status >/dev/null 2>&1; then

# Check Semaphore
if curl -sfk https://10.10.20.10:2443/api/ping >/dev/null 2>&1; then
```

**Estimated time:** 20 minutes

---

### Task 5: OPNsense Playbook References

**Files to check:**
- `ansible/playbooks/services/opnsense-*.yml`

**Action:** Search for any hardcoded service URLs and update to HTTPS

```bash
# Search command:
grep -r "10.10.20.10:9000\|10.10.20.10:3000\|10.10.20.10:8080" ansible/playbooks/services/opnsense-*
```

Update any found references to new HTTPS URLs.

**Estimated time:** 15 minutes

---

### Task 6: Documentation

**Files to create/update:**

1. **Quick-Start Card Text** (for physical card that ships with device)

Create: `documentation/quick-start-card.md`

```markdown
# PrivateBox Quick Start

1. Connect PrivateBox to your network
2. Visit: https://10.10.20.10:8081 (Homer Dashboard)
3. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed" when warned about certificate
   (This is normal - PrivateBox uses self-signed HTTPS)
4. Bookmark the page
5. Click service tiles to access

Default Password: (printed on device label)

Troubleshooting: https://docs.privatebox.io
```

2. **User Guide Update**

Add to `documentation/USER-GUIDE.md` (or create if doesn't exist):

```markdown
## Understanding Certificate Warnings

PrivateBox uses self-signed HTTPS certificates for security without requiring:
- Domain purchase ($15/year ongoing cost)
- External DNS services (privacy concern)
- Internet connectivity for certificate renewal

**What to expect:**
- First visit: Browser shows "Your connection is not private"
- Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to 10.10.20.10"
- Browser remembers your choice
- Normal browsing from then on

**This is the same approach used by:**
- UniFi Dream Machine
- Firewalla Gold
- Synology NAS
- pfSense / OPNsense

**For advanced users:**
Optional Let's Encrypt setup available (requires domain ownership).
See: Advanced Configuration Guide
```

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

## Testing Checklist

After completing all tasks, test full flow:

```bash
# Delete all VMs
ssh root@192.168.1.10 "qm stop 100 101 9000 && qm destroy 100 101 9000"

# Run quickstart
ssh root@192.168.1.10 "curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rasped/privatebox/main/quickstart.sh | bash"

# Verify services (from workstation browser):
# 1. https://10.10.20.10:8081  - Homer (HTTP - just links)
# 2. https://10.10.20.10:1443  - Portainer (HTTPS, accept cert)
# 3. https://10.10.20.10:2443  - Semaphore (HTTPS, accept cert)
# 4. https://10.10.20.10:3443  - AdGuard (HTTPS, accept cert)
# 5. https://10.10.20.10:4443  - Headscale (HTTPS, accept cert)

# Test orchestration completes
# Check logs for errors
```

## Implementation Notes

### Why Self-Signed (Not Let's Encrypt)?

**Decision rationale** (from earlier analysis):
- ✅ Works out of box (zero config)
- ✅ No ongoing costs (keeps "no subscriptions" promise)
- ✅ No cloud dependencies (privacy promise)
- ✅ Works offline (recovery promise)
- ✅ Competitive parity (UniFi/Firewalla use self-signed)
- ✅ Support scales (simple FAQ vs DNS troubleshooting)
- ✅ Never expires (10 year cert)

### Why These Port Numbers?

**Sequential x443 pattern:**
- Visual consistency: "443" suffix = HTTPS
- Easy to remember: Service 1, 2, 3, 4...
- Professional appearance
- Leaves room for future services (5443, 6443, etc.)

### Why Not Caddy Reverse Proxy?

**Decision rationale:**
- Container limitations for Let's Encrypt upgrades later
- Single point of failure for all services
- More complex to debug
- Native HTTPS keeps services independent

- Task 5 (OPNsense refs): 15 min
- Task 6 (Documentation): 30 min
- Testing: 30 min

**Total: ~2.5 hours**

## Commit Strategy

Suggested commit sequence:

1. **Commit 1:** "Fix AdGuard uri tasks for self-signed certs"
   - Just add validate_certs: no to all uri tasks
   - Quick win, unblocks AdGuard deployment

2. **Commit 2:** "Implement Headscale HTTPS on port 4443"
   - Complete Headscale configuration
   - Similar pattern to AdGuard

3. **Commit 3:** "Update all service URLs and documentation"
   - Homer, bootstrap, verify-install
   - Documentation
   - Complete the feature

## Next Steps

1. Review this handover
2. Decide implementation approach:
   - A) Implement all tasks now (~2.5 hours)
   - B) Implement task-by-task with commits
   - C) Use helper script for repetitive changes
3. Test full flow
4. Update CLAUDE.md if timing expectations change

## Questions / Blockers

None currently. All patterns established, just execution remaining.
